  "url": "https://itexamanswers.net/ccna-1-packet-tracer-labs-answers-itn-v7-02.html",

  "summary": "This Packet Tracer Physical Mode activity introduces students to both logical and physical network views, network device categories, wiring closets, cabling, device installation, and basic console configuration. The scenario simulates a small-to-medium business network with branch and datacenter components.",

    {
      "id": "ccna1-pt-1.0.5-0",
      "section": "Objectives",
      "text": "The activity includes: exploring the bottom toolbar, reviewing wiring closet components, connecting end devices, installing a backup router, configuring a hostname through console access, and examining other areas of the network."

      "id": "ccna1-pt-1.0.5-1",
      "section": "Background",
      "text": "The network layout mimics a typical business environment. Many devices are preconfigured. Learners can freely explore both logical and physical modes or follow structured steps."

      "id": "ccna1-pt-1.0.5-2",
      "section": "Physical vs Logical Mode",
      "text": "The activity focuses primarily on Physical Mode. Users can switch between modes to compare hardware layout, cabling, rack-mounted devices, workspace navigation, and device labeling."

      "id": "ccna1-pt-1.0.5-3",
      "section": "Part 1: Bottom Toolbar",
      "text": "The toolbar includes device categories such as routers, switches, hubs, wireless devices, security appliances, and WAN emulation. Additional categories cover end devices, components, media connectors, and multiuser tools."

    {
      "id": "ccna1-pt-1.0.5-4",
      "section": "Part 2: Wiring Closet Exploration",
      "text": "Inside the wiring closet, students identify racks, shelves, tables, and pegboards. Router and switch placement is shown. Devices connected to switch ALS2 include ALS1, Access_Point, and a Web Server. Laptop_1 is wirelessly linked to Access_Point and is located on the table."

    {
      "id": "ccna1-pt-1.0.5-5",
      "section": "Part 3: Connecting Devices",
      "text": "Learners inspect cable types (console, copper, USB, fiber, coax). They practice connecting a PC to a switch using copper cabling and connecting a console cable from the PC to the Edge_Router for management access."
    },
    {
      "id": "ccna1-pt-1.0.5-6",
      "section": "Part 4: Installing Backup Router",
      "text": "A backup router is mounted in the rack, powered on through the rear panel, and connected to a laptop using a USB-console cable because newer devices rely on USB for management connectivity."
    },
    {
      "id": "ccna1-pt-1.0.5-7",
      "section": "Part 5: Hostname Configuration",
      "text": "Using the console connection via the laptop, the student enters privileged EXEC mode, opens global configuration, and changes the router's hostname to 'Edge_Router_Backup'. Packet Tracer distinguishes between the display name and actual device hostname."

    {
      "id": "ccna1-pt-1.0.5-8",
      "section": "Part 6: Explore Network",
      "text": "Learners are encouraged to explore additional network areas like the data center and teleworker home, observing device layout and configurations in both modes."
